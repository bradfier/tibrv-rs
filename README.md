[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bradfier/tibrv-rs.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/bradfier/tibrv-rs) [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tibrv.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tibrv)

Rust bindings for TIBCO Rendezvous, a message-oriented middleware.

[Documentation](https://bradfier.github.io/tibrv-rs/)

tibrv is a set of Rust bindings to the [C Implementation](https://docs.tibco.com/pub/rendezvous/8.4.0-february-2012/doc/pdf/tib_rv_c_reference.pdf)
provided by TIBCO.

tibrv is still rapidly developing, and as evidenced by the empty 0.0.0 version published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tibrv)
is not ready for use in real projects. However, please clone this repo and hack on what's been published so far!

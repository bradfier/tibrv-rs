# Contributing to tibrv-rs

Thanks for your interest in contributing to tibrv-rs!

Right now there are three main ways you can help, detailed below:

* [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
* [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)
* [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)

## Feature Requests
[feature-requests]: #feature-requests

tibrv-rs is a library with a fairly niche use-case and user-base, so if
you find a feature is missing, or the library doesn't work well for your
particular needs, it's entirely possible that something has been overlooked!

If you feel like a critical feature has gone unimplemented, or an API
change would make your life a lot easier, please open an issue and give
us feedback on what you would like changed.


## Bug Reports
[bug-reports]: #bug-reports

If you've found a bug in the library, please open an issue describing
the problem. Please include the version of tibrv-rs you're using, and
the version of Rendezvous you are building against.

If possible, please try and reproduce the bug against the latest
supported Rendezvous version!


## Pull Requests
[pull-requests]: #pull-requests

If you've created a fix for a bug, or an implementation for a new
feature, please create a pull request against the `master` branch so
your changes can be brought into the main repository.

Any changes should have unit tests and doc comments, and any new
features could also have an example or two documenting their usage.

All code in tibrv-rs is formatted with the default `rustfmt` profile,
please run `cargo fmt` before submitting your pull request.

## Licensing
Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be dual licensed as described in [README.md](README.md).
